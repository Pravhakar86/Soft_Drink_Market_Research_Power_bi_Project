# Soft_Drink_Market_Research_Power_bi_Project
As a skilled Power BI analyst, I conducted a comprehensive market research and analysis in the Food & Beverage industry, focusing on soft drinks. By evaluating consumer preferences, competition, and marketing channels, I provided valuable insights to the marketing team. I recommended immediate improvements to the product, identified the ideal price range, suggested effective marketing campaigns, and proposed a suitable brand ambassador and target audience.
